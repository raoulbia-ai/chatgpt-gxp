Significant efficiency improvements can be achieved by focusing on what is essential in individual situations and avoiding unnecessary work. Critical thinking is not a one-time activity and should be applied throughout the computerized system life cycle. As such, critical thinking should become a habitual mindset based on an intellectual commitment to continual improvement. Figure \n.5 illustrates critical thinking for computerized systems whereby proactive adoption of a risk-based approach suitable for the intended use of the computerized system takes into account the multiple layers of assurance provided elsewhere within the business process. In other words, combining technical, procedural, and behavioral controls applied throughout the business process is used when assessing the risk of the computerized system. These layers of assurance may exist upstream or downstream of the system within the business process it supports and include supplier activities \n. This holistic approach requires an initial investment of time and effort to analyze the overall business process that the computerized system will support, and the associated regulated data. For example, the value of strong, validated data integrity technical controls in the system could be negated by errors caused by manual transcription of regulated data into the system. Data integrity cannot be recovered once lost. Business process mapping and data flow diagrams capture this knowledge and facilitate the identification and understanding of the potential risks to patient safety, product quality, and data integrity to determine where assurance is most needed. Regulatory authorities are adopting critical thinking to help determine whether controls are fit for intended use to ensure patient safety, product quality, and data integrity. Practitioners should not consider that the level of regulatory compliance achieved is directly proportionate to the amount of paperwork produced. Too much paperwork can confuse and make it harder to maintain and inspect computerized systems. Regulators look for scaled and targeted activities with well-organized information and records that have an appropriate level of detail, supported by clear and unambiguous rationales explaining the critical thinking applied. The information/records contained within software development and support tools offer the opportunity to demonstrate control in areas where separate documentation was previously considered a necessity, and these should be leveraged \n.

					},
					{
						"head": "Note:",
						"p": [
							"The increased use of Agile approaches and supporting software development tools as well as the appropriate generation of information and records rather than paper documentation, should be taken into consideration when assessing suppliers. References to documentation/documented evidence are often interpreted within a very narrow context of traditional approved documents/specifications rather than seeing these also as records/information/artifacts within software tools.",
							"The computerized system supplier should build quality and integrity into a software product during development, as it cannot be added effectively (e.g., through testing and rework) later by the regulated company. The supplier is also better positioned to produce most of the required information during the development process. Suppliers should, therefore, be assessed to determine the adequacy of their development and support processes, and the supplierassessment approach described in this appendix provides a scalable approach to carrying out such an assessment.",
							"For many systems there is likely to be more than one supplier and each of the suppliers within the supply chain should be considered for assessment. In some cases, a single supplier may provide several components or perform a number of activities, in other cases multiple suppliers may be involved. It should be noted that in the case of audits of cloud service providers, particularly SaaS providers, the audit may be limited to the primary service provider. If there is no contract in place with other supplementary service providers in the supply chain beyond that, audits for all providers will not be possible and therefore such a provider may be considered unacceptable.",
							"Consideration should be given to the scope of products and services to be assessed. It is considered inefficient to focus the process solely on one product required by a project when the regulated company is likely to use a wider range of products or services from the supplier. By adopting a broader approach, multiple assessments can be avoided -this is often a particular issue for larger, globally regulated companies where supplier-assessment coordination across the company can be difficult.",
							"Supplier assessments also are an opportunity to develop relationships with suppliers, to clarify expectations and intentions, and to identify misunderstandings and risks. The assessment process enables the regulated company to establish a picture of the supplier's operation, which is vital input when planning specification and verification activities. The assessment report should, therefore, provide a balanced view of what was found, including positive observations, along with a list of concerns."

							"• What are the hazards?",
							"To recognize the hazards to a computerized system requires judgment and understanding of what could go wrong with the system based on relevant knowledge and experience of the process and its automation. Consideration should include both system failures and user failures.",
							"• What is the harm?",
							"Potential harm should be identified based on hazards. Examples of potential harm include:",
							"-Production of adulterated product caused by the failure of a computerized system -Failure of an instrument at a clinical site that leads to inaccurate clinical study conclusions -Failure of a computerized system used to assess a toxicology study that leads to incomplete understanding of a drug's toxicological profile -Failure leads to supply interruption and a potential drug shortage",
							"• What is the impact?",
							"In order to understand the impact on patient safety, product quality, and data integrity, it is necessary to estimate the possible consequence of a hazard.",
							"• What is the probability of a failure?",
							"Understanding the probability of a failure occurring to a computerized system assists with the selection of appropriate controls to manage the identified risks. For some types of failure such as software failure, however, it may be very difficult to assign such a value, thus precluding the use of probability in quantitative risk assessments. To some extent, probability of failure aligns with the GAMP Categories 1-5; as complexity is introduced, failure likelihood increases.",
							"• What is the detectability of a failure?",
							"Understanding the detectability of a failure also assists with the selection of appropriate controls to manage the identified risks. Failures may be detected automatically by the system or by manual methods. Detection is useful only if it occurs before the consequences of the failure cause harm to patient safety, product quality, or data integrity. Similar to the above, the categories are paralleled; as the complexity of failure detection processes increase, the likelihood of undetected failure increases. This applies to both manual and (generally more reliable) automated processes.",
							"• How will the risk be managed?",
							"Risk can be eliminated or reduced by design, or reduced to an acceptable level, by applying controls that reduce the probability of occurrence or increase detectability. Controls may be automated, manual, or a combination of both.",
							"The above considerations are context sensitive. For example, risks associated with a solid oral dosage manufacturing area are very different to those in a sterile facility, even when the same computerized systems are used.",
							"Similarly, the risks associated with an adverse event reporting system are very different to those in a training records database. The former can have a direct effect of patient safety, whereas the latter system is very unlikely to affect patient safety.",
							"It is worth noting that zero risk is usually an unattainable goal, and there are diminishing returns as it is approached. Instead, companies need to think in terms of acceptable risk, sometimes known as risk tolerance. Risk tolerance is context dependent, taking into account a variety of patient safety, data integrity, business, and regulatory considerations, and it is not necessarily the same for similar processes in one company, or even for identical processes in different companies. For example, risk tolerance related to product release is lower for a life-saving oncology drug than it is for an allergy cream, even though the processes may be identical. There should be greater care and rigor exercised for the oncology drug.",
							"It is not unusual for risks to have multiple potential impacts. It is highly advisable to recognize what the worst-case scenario may be. However, when deciding what mitigation steps to apply, that may not always be the best focus.",
							"If the likelihood of a worst-case outcome is vanishingly small it may make more sense to focus on other potential negative outcomes. This illustrates why a truly effective risk-management process is critical."

Infrastructure code is subject to configuration management ensuring that all code changes are traceable. Infrastructure code development is subject to risk-based software development practices that ensure code is developed in accordance with a life cycle approach including verification prior to deployment. Configuration management and deployment tools allow for review and authorization prior to deployment of new/updated configurations, use of templates to ensure maintenance of consistent configurations across the infrastructure landscape, and monitoring of the configuration baseline to detect unauthorized changes. A further benefit to this being that a \"one qualification, many deployments\" approach can be taken, particularly with standard virtualized environments.",
							"The configuration of standard infrastructure components is part of the creation of basic building blocks that are the foundational platforms for applications. Such configuration processes are readily automated. For example, an outof-the-box server can have the operating system, middleware, layered software, and security policies loaded via an automated process. There may be multiple similar automated build scripts, for example, to build servers with different database engines. These automated builds can produce various log files or even perform simple automated tests that demonstrate a successful build, and a review-by-exception process similar in principle to that used for pharmaceutical manufacturing obviates the need for further verification. Critical thinking must be applied when deploying such \"standard\" environments, however. In some cases, greater control may be warranted; for example, cybersecurity risks may differ from one example to the next, which might merit hardening of the security for an otherwise standard component."

SMEs should be consulted on when and where particular regulations are applicable. For example, critical thinking should be applied to identify GxP regulated records that need an audit trail rather than defaulting to all data requiring audit trails regardless of context. Critical thinking can then be applied again to evaluate what is needed in terms of a data audit trail taking into account whether users are expected to create, modify, or delete regulated records during normal operation.",

Furthermore, required changes may be implemented more rapidly than they could be by a commercial supplier, due to the availability of several possible coding authors. However, it is up to the organization using the OSS to monitor for, import, and apply those updates.

However, because blockchains are ecosystem-level systems, collusion with other parties would be needed to continually propagate false information, which is unlikely. In addition, there would always be a clear log of transactions. To this end it is important to know exactly who the business partners are (that is, the addresses they control on the blockchain) and to recognize that the system is more secure when looking at the sum of the parts. Because it is most likely that enterprises will interact with blockchains through APIs, GxP considerations must be applied to the blockchain network as well as the ancillary systems that push and pull information to it."

The amount of logical branching in the application is a good gauge for complexity; if many logic functions (IF, AND, OR, etc.) or lookup tables are used, complexity is higher. Although they are native functions, these introduce more potential pathways through the application, and such branching requires a more sophisticated or thorough test strategy.",

Even when created by keystroke capture, there is a program in a high-level language like VBA behind it.

Macros should be challenged in documented functional testing. Macros that include logical branches should be subject to greater rigor, with attention paid to multiple logic paths.",

These controls may, however, be ineffective in keeping the application author from making changes outside of a change control process, especially if the application resides on an individual workstation. In some cases, it may be possible to improve security by running the end user application on a network drive on which the user's rights are limited, and which includes a regular scheduled back-up process.",

Ensuring adequate data integrity held in spreadsheets requires the use of strict controls, including any required electronic record controls. Where spreadsheets are subject to edit, it is difficult to establish whether original data in subsequently saved copies has been edited. In such cases adequate control can be provided through the use of an EDMS. Alternatively, it may be necessary to maintain controlled copies in an unalterable format, e.g., PDF or hardcopy.
