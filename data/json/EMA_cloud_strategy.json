							"EMA's newly developed cloud strategy takes into account both the increased adoption of cloud technologies at EMA as well as the evolution of the public cloud market in recent years. This strategy will act as a guideline for EMA's cloud adoption in the coming years, providing the Agency with the principles and approach to fully benefit from the potential of cloud-based technologies.",
							"In 2017, EMA adopted a cloud strategy which promoted the opportunistic adoption of Software as a Service (SaaS) and \"using public cloud solutions where the right controls can be put in place, where there is business value and where EMA can realise its business objectives\". From a long-term perspective, the strategy endorsed \"transitioning application and infrastructure platform services to a cloud-based provisioning mode\". This new strategy builds and expands upon this initial effort. It contains a built-in focus on security, data protection and compliance, which will be embedded in both existing and new solutions by design and can be elevated to new levels with the help of state-of-the-art solutions powered by the cloud.",
							"It will accelerate digitalisation and innovation initiatives, increasing the return on IT investments and maximising the quality of EMA's services towards EU citizens and companies. More specifically, this strategy is aligned with the principles of the European Digital Strategy, and it will enable EMA to accelerate the adoption of the European Health Data Space, in particular the pillars regarding 'data quality and interoperability' and 'infrastructure and technology."

							"This new cloud strategy allows EMA to further transform its business and way of working in support of its mission towards public and animal health in the EU. Strategic adoption of the right cloud technologies will make it easier for EMA to meet its requirements regarding the exchange of data and collaboration at the European and global level. They enable a decentralised and collaborative method of exchanging large amounts of data in a secure and regulated way, without the burden of having to fully build and manage a large IT estate. By moving to the cloud, EMA will promote digitalisation throughout the Agency, allowing it to provide higher quality services to both its own Adopting this strategy will put EMA in a strong position to reach its objective of fully migrating to the cloud by 2025.",

The cloud offers access to modern and AI powered data lake solutions, built specifically for dealing with rapidly increasing amounts of data coming from a wide variety of sources. New insights and implications can be derived from unstructured data sources such as patient records and regulatory submissions.",
							"Modern cloud platforms provide access to state-of-the-art technologies which were difficult or unrealistic to adopt in the past but can now be accessed and scaled at the click of a button.",
							"They can be more efficiently incorporated into new solutions and updated or extended as new innovations hit the market, allowing EMA to efficiently respond to a rapidly increasing demand. Running both traditional and/or state-of-the art technologies is facilitated in the cloud as the cloud provides seamless updates and a very high level of availability and risk tolerance which would require substantial investments to achieve on-premise.",
							"Additionally, new opportunities are becoming available for regulatory and administrative process automation and integration, drastically reducing the need for custom developed solutions which are difficult to maintain and tend to deprecate over time.",
							"The cloud offers EMA an opportunity to adopt a more consistent approach towards technology in the future. Ad-hoc and custom solutions will be avoided whenever possible while still offering the flexibility and agility a modern public sector organisation requires to serve the ever-growing expectations of the citizens and businesses in the EU. Considering EMA's experience with data centre procurement, increased cloud adoption will also guarantee improved stability in terms of the residency of EMA's solutions and avoid potential relocations of infrastructure driven by procurement cycles and other uncontrollable events. While relocations might still be necessary, relocations between cloud providers are less cumbersome than traditional on-premises relocations. Procurement cycles are still accommodated for in the context of a best-in-breed adoption of cloud technologies in a multi-cloud future.",
							"The cloud also provides EMA with a high level of transparency with regards to what services are being used and which expenses they generate, making it easier for EMA to forecast, manage and report costs. Together with the various cost-saving payment models by the cloud, the cloud provides EMA with various options to be more cost efficient."

During its future cloud journey, EMA will carefully and consistently tackle the different challenges which are typical of such an engagement.",
							"Cloud comes in different flavours, mainly referred to as IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service) and SaaS (Software as a Service), with different levels of responsibility and flexibility split between the cloud service provider and EMA. The choice between these service models will be driven by user requirements, the stability or expected pace of evolution of the solution(s), and of course the familiarity of the EMA workforce with the technologies and their compliance with security and data protection requirements.",
							"Besides selecting a service model to adopt, EMA will also establish an organisational and digital mindset oriented towards continuous learning and improvement. This strategy will link with other ongoing initiatives at EMA to influence a cultural shift towards this direction. This will help create a constant awareness and openness for modernisation potential in the application landscape of EMA. Through this strategy, EMA leadership commits to fostering such culture as well as prioritising initiatives and learning needs in order to ensure the capabilities of the Agency's IT teams. Processes and procedures for managing EMA's IT will be updated, and a solid cloud governance will be put in place to connect all relevant teams and help them achieve these goals.",
							"As the adoption and footprint of cloud technologies increases, EMA will constantly evaluate the skill requirements of its IT team and identify the gaps that might exist today, but also anticipate those skills which will be required in the future. To bridge these gaps, relevant training programmes will be developed and where relevant recruitment and sourcing strategies can be put in place to address specific skill gaps."

EMA will leverage these possibilities in the cloud to ensure adequate security and protection of its information assets.",

More specifically, these include the Schrems II judgement and the Regulation 2018/1725 for EU institutions.

These domains form an overview through which EMA will implement certain governance mechanisms in the cloud.",

This approach can be applied to any Windows or Linux virtual servers with cloud friendly workloads (i.e. small application footprint / minimal dependencies & interfaces and configuration changes on OS, Webserver, Approver, DB Stack level only-instead of at the application code level).

							"The purpose for which personal data is processed will be registered and will ensure that no more personal data than necessary will be processed.",
							"For processing and transfers the purpose of data operations will be registered at the moment of data collection and that additional processing activities need to be validated with the original purpose if there is a need for additional use of data.",

Managed alerting and notification services provided by cloud service providers will enable EMA to automatically inform data subjects in a timely fashion, thereby reducing substantial operational overhead.",
							"• Right of access: The availability feature of cloud services makes them conveniently accessible to end users. On the other hand, it will also allow possibilities for EMA to automate this process. Moreover, data portability will be ensured.",
							"• Data retention: Personal data may not be stored longer than needed for the predefined purpose. Therefore, retention periods will be implemented, and data will be effectively deleted across all data storages when retention periods expire. To identify and manage multijurisdictional retention requirements, we will implement the following best practices:",
							"• Contractually stipulate the retention and deletion policy that must be implemented;",
							"• Stipulate contractually that the Cloud Service Provider will support EMA with deletion of data in all locations if required;",

Best practice is, for example, the encryption of data storage with customermanaged keys. Hence, EMA will focus on embedding PETs in the adoption of the public cloud.",
							"• Data security: Personal data needs to be adequately protected. Hence, EMA will utilise the existing risks management practices and define further technical and organisational measures for cloud usage to ensure data is adequately protected and take up their part of the shared responsibility in cloud management. Conversely, EMA will ensure Cloud Service Providers also manage their part of the shared responsibly in adequately implementing data security practices.",
							"• Access to data: Best practice is to limit access to data to people from the organisation on a need-to-know basis. However, it could be the case a CSP wants to access the environment. This type of access by the provider shall be managed on a case-by-case basis to ensure compliance with relevant rules and regulations.",
							"• Procurement of Cloud Services: Before procurement of cloud services/providers there needs to be a (privacy) risk assessment performed that assesses whether the envisioned data operations may be performed, privacy risks can be managed, and the providers offers a sufficient level of security measures. This risk assessment may be performed in line with existing EMA risk management practices. The outcome of the risk assessment will be used to further enhance SLA requirements and/or contractual clauses if necessary. This will be done according to the guidelines defined by the EDPS11. In addition, earlier recommendations from the EDPS' investigation of Microsoft services that include recommendations for EU institutions will also be implemented.
