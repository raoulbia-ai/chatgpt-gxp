When discussing legal aspects, we need to strictly differentiate the contractual side (e.g., warranty) from the intellectual property (copyright) side of the subject.\",\n\"Let us first take the perspective of a typical software user: in case the intended use of OSS is acquiring, installing, and running (typically the case for Linux, MySQL, or Apache) without changing the software, the legal situation is not much different compared to the situation of buying commercial software. Even if the source code of the software will be changed in order to adapt the software functionality to the requirements there are normally no legal implications, as long as it is not distributed to others. However, the user should be aware that with using OSS, a contractual relationship is potentially entered that may encompass contractual and copyright aspects. As with commercial software, the purchaser should ensure that the supplier grants software to be free of rights of third parties.\",\n\"The perspective of a software supplier or integrator is, compared to a normal OSS user, more complex: OSS license conditions and additional country-specific legislation need to be considered when OSS software is used as a basis for developing new software which is being distributed later. Depending on the OSS license model, the distributor is subject to some OSS specific obligations. For example, the BSD-type licenses (e.g., Apache Server) allow modifications of the OSS software and commercial distribution without disclosure of the source code. On the other hand, the GNU General Public License requires the (modified) source code to be published. It also requires that the source code of software, which has been combined with OSS -Software, needs to be published.

Usually, only a small number of trusted developers (called maintainers) have write access to the source code repository, being able to make changes to the main development line. However, other contributors can make a copy of the code (for example, through public, read-only access to the repository) and develop their own contributions based on those copies. They submit a file containing their changes (patch file) to the maintainers, who review it, and if deemed adequate, integrate it to the main code branch.\",\n\"Branching may lead to separate development streams.

Furthermore, if the modified OSS product is given to third parties (e.g., as part of an embedded system), it may even be necessary to contribute the changes to the community, depending on the OSS license.
